# Final Evaluation: Html & CSS

## Yanira FernÃ¡ndez Requena

This is the page I made for the final evaluation of the Html and CSS module in Adalab. We were given a design on Zeplin that we were to emulate as best as we could.

**Requirements:**

1. Fixed hamburguer button top left of the screen. This has to be a link to Adalab front page.
2. Anonnymous proxy module had to be fullscreen size.
3. 3 Reassons to Purchase module layout using Grid.
4. Footer layout using Flex. All links direct to Adalab.

**Interactions:**

1. Header arrow scrolls to 3 Reassons to Purchase section.
2. Footer arrow scrolls to top.
3. "Go" & "More Reasons" buttons transition on hover.
4. **BONUS** Footer arrow animation.
